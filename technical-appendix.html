  <h1>MANDEVAL – Technical appendix</h1>
  <p>
    This appendix summarises how the MANDEVAL tool treats cost and benefit inputs, and how
    the MandEval preference estimates feed into the “Expected public support (%)” metric.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Scope.</strong> The focus is on transparency rather than prescribing specific
    numbers. All cost and benefit parameters can be adjusted by users to reflect local data.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Preference model inputs</h2>
  <p>
    MANDEVAL uses the mean coefficients from the MandEval mixed logit models estimated
    separately for Australia, France and Italy, under mild and severe outbreak frames.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternatives: two mandate options and a “no mandate” opt-out.</li>
    <li>Attributes: scope, exemptions, coverage threshold and expected lives saved per 100,000.</li>
    <li>
      For each country and outbreak frame, the tool stores the mixed logit mean coefficients
      for:
      <ul>
        <li>ASC for a mandate alternative</li>
        <li>ASC for the opt-out (no mandate)</li>
        <li>Scope: all occupations and public spaces (vs high-risk only)</li>
        <li>Exemptions: medical + religious; medical + religious + personal (vs medical only)</li>
        <li>Coverage: 70% and 90% thresholds (vs 50%)</li>
        <li>Expected lives saved per 100,000 (continuous term)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For a given configuration (country, outbreak frame, scope, exemptions, coverage, lives saved
    per 100,000), the tool computes a mandate utility and a no-mandate utility and applies a
    simple logit formula to obtain the probability of choosing the mandate over no mandate.
    This probability is reported as “Model-based public support (%)”.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Cost parameters</h2>
  <p>
    Costs are grouped into four main categories, entered as totals over the relevant time horizon:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Implementation in the tool</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Government administration and IT</td>
      <td>
        IT systems and digital infrastructure (apps, QR code generation and verification,
        backend databases), staff time for processing passes and exemptions, and general
        administrative overhead in health and other ministries.
      </td>
      <td>
        Entered as a single amount in the <em>Costs</em> tab and added directly to total cost.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Communication and outreach</td>
      <td>
        Public information campaigns, hotline services, community engagement,
        translation and accessible formats.
      </td>
      <td>
        Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. Users can distinguish
        one-off and recurring costs in their own underlying sheets if needed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enforcement and compliance</td>
      <td>
        Inspections and compliance checks at workplaces and public venues, labour inspectorate
        work related to mandates, and support from police or other authorities in crowd management.
      </td>
      <td>
        Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. Users can document the assumed
        inspection frequency and staffing pattern in the notes field.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Compensation and support</td>
      <td>
        Temporary income support or hardship schemes linked to mandates (e.g. support for
        workers affected by testing requirements or temporary suspensions), and any dedicated
        compensation programmes for adverse events.
      </td>
      <td>
        Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. Distributional questions
        (who pays, who benefits) can be elaborated outside the tool.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    The tool computes a total programme cost as the sum of these four components. More granular
    breakdowns (e.g. separating test kit procurement, laboratory processing and productivity
    loss due to time spent testing) can be developed in background spreadsheets and rolled up
    into the four main entries.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Epidemiological benefits</h2>
  <p>
    The key epidemiological input is the expected lives saved per 100,000 people under the
    mandate compared with an appropriate counterfactual (e.g. voluntary vaccination under
    the same outbreak scenario).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Users specify a value for “Expected lives saved per 100,000”, which corresponds to the
      MandEval DCE attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
      The tool converts this into total lives saved by multiplying by the exposed population
      and dividing by 100,000.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users also enter a “Value per life saved” (for example a value of a statistical life).
      The tool multiplies this by total lives saved to derive a monetary benefit.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Benefit–cost ratio and feasibility</h2>
  <p>
    The benefit–cost ratio (BCR) is computed as:
  </p>
  <p><code>BCR = Monetary benefit / Total cost</code></p>
  <p>
    No discounting is performed inside the app; users are expected to ensure that all costs
    and benefits are expressed over the same time horizon and in present-value terms if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model-based public support is used alongside the BCR to provide a simple feasibility
    signal:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>≥ 70%</strong> – “Favourable”</li>
    <li><strong>50–69%</strong> – “Mixed”</li>
    <li><strong>&lt; 50%</strong> – “Challenging”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Interpretation and limitations</h2>
  <p>
    The numerical outputs are sensitive to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The lives-saved inputs and their underlying epidemiological assumptions</li>
    <li>The chosen value per life saved</li>
    <li>How costs are measured and allocated between government, employers and individuals</li>
    <li>The choice of outbreak scenario and mandate design</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The MandEval preferences used to calculate public support are based on survey data
    at a particular point in time. They capture stated preferences under experimental
    conditions, not actual voting or behavioural responses. They are most useful for
    comparing mandate designs <em>within</em> a country rather than predicting precise
    approval percentages.
